The dataset includes 1438 images.
Cards-KM2x are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Fit within)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -20 and +20 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -14 and +14 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 0.7 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.77 percent of pixels
